I did this project from The Odin Project. It was a basic association and data modelling project meant to get you comfortable with buliding simple web applications with normal associations.

The project specified to create a User, Post, and Comment model where a User could create a Post and a Comment, and that a Comment could be created on a Post. I decided to make the project a little more sophisticated and I made my Comments polymorphic so that they could be attached to a Comment or a Post. 

This was a great learning experience for me, I had never worked with polymorphic associations before and I think that I came out of this project with a slightly better understanding of how to implement this in later projects down the road.

I also wrote all of this test first using RSpec. I want this time through the Rails section to be slightly more applicable to the job environment and also give me a chance to write tests to become better at it.
